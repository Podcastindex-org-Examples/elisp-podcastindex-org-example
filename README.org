* Podcastindex.org elisp example

This is an example of how to connect to the podcastindex API in elisp.

Before running the code, ensure you have the *request* library installed from MELPA.

After entering the API key and secret and saving the file, open up an IELM repl and load the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load "~/src/elisp-example/elisp-example.org")
#+END_SRC

Once the elisp file is loaded, the Index can be searched with the following function call in IELM:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (api-search "No Agenda")
#+END_SRC
